## About This Repository

This repository is a snapshot of my former blog `www.internet-solutions.si`, encapsulated within a complete WordPress 3.0.1 site. It encompasses all necessary components, including themes, plugins, uploads, and a MySQL database dump, allowing you to run the entire blog locally or on a server with minimal setup.

> **Note**: This repository is a historical archive. You can also see this web page in the past on WayBackMachine [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20110919165701/http://www.internet-solutions.si/).

### My Tech Odyssey

This blog has been a significant part of my journey, serving as a platform for sharing insights, experiences, and innovations within the tech industry. This archive offers a glimpse into various topics I've explored over the years, from web development to mobile applications.

### Running the Archive

Since this repository contains a complete WordPress site setup, you can get the blog up and running with a few simple steps. It's a perfect opportunity for those interested in historical tech content, WordPress development, or my journey in technology.

## Getting Started

To run this WordPress site, you'll need a suitable environment that supports PHP and MySQL. I recommend using a local environment like XAMPP, MAMP, or WAMP.

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/loncarales/internet-solutions.si.git
    ```

2. **Import the Database**:
   - Locate the `sqldump` folder.
   - Import the `isolutions-2009-06-19.sql` file into your MySQL database using a tool like phpMyAdmin.

3. **Configure wp-config.php**:
   - Update the `wp-config.php` file with your database details (database name, username, password, and host).

4. **Serve the Website**:
   - If using a local server, place the repository contents in the root directory (e.g., `htdocs` in XAMPP) and navigate to `localhost/www.internet-solutions.si` in your web browser.
